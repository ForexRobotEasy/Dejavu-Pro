# Dejavu Pro - Trading Robot

This code implements the algorithmic filtering system of Dejavu Pro, a trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It executes trades based on price movements within a specific time period, following short trends simultaneously for quick market movements. The code is optimized specifically for XAUUSD trading and adapts to changing market conditions for consistent profitability.

To use this code, the necessary libraries Trade and Expert are included. The global variables `trade`, `timePeriod`, and `slippage` are declared. The expert advisor is initialized in the `OnInit()` function, setting the deviation in points for slippage.

The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick and checks if a new time period has started using the `IsNewTimePeriod()` function. If a new time period has started and the price movements pass the algorithmic filtering system implemented in the `FilterPriceMovements()` function, trades are executed based on the unique algorithm in the `ExecuteTrades()` function.

The `IsNewTimePeriod()` function checks if the time period in seconds has reached the specified `timePeriod` and if the current time is greater than the last time period. If both conditions are met, it returns true and updates the last time period.

The `TimePeriodInSeconds()` function calculates the time period in seconds by rounding the current time to the next time period and subtracting the current time.

The `FilterPriceMovements()` function is where the algorithmic filtering logic is implemented. This function should return true if the price movements pass the filter, otherwise false.

The `ExecuteTrades()` function is where the trading logic is implemented. The trade object is used to execute trades based on the unique algorithm.
